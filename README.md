# floq
FLOQ - A fast Python library for doing Floquet-based quantum control optimisation

This code is in active development and not intended for practical use! The repository also contains things it shouldn't for a release version, such as the benchmarks.

Still, if you end up using it right now for some mysterious reason, I'd love to talk, drop me a line at me@(username).com!
